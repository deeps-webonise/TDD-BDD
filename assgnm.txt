				LOGIN SYSTEM

A Login system has two parts:
1)Sign up
2)Log in


Sign up has 3 fields namely:- 

Username 

Password

Email

A username is valid only if:
size of username is between 3 and 32
No special character is there

Password is valid only if:
size of password is between 8 and 32
No capital letter ,small letter ,number or special character
(for eg: Hello_123)

Email is valid only if
there are alpha-numeric present before and after @
alpha-numeric@alpha-numeric



Now an input is positive only if the above conditions are met.



Sample set input for this system is
[{deep,Hello_123,deep@gmail.com},{anuj,Awesome_123,anuj@ymail.com},{ajay,232132,ajay@hotmail.com},{nikhil,Great_123,nikgmail.com},{ami,Ami_1234,ami@gmail.com}]


Sample set of output is
[You Have Registered successfully, You Have Registered successfully,ERROR(due to password),ERROR(due to email),ERROR(due to username)]

The positive input for this will the subset is:

[{deep,Hello_123,deep@gmail.com},
{anuj,Awesome_123,anuj@ymail.com}

The negative input for this will be the subset which will yield an error is this:
[{ajay,232132,ajay@hotmail.com},
{nikhil,Great_123,nikgmail.com},
{ami,Ami_1234,ami@gmail.com}]

So the acceptance criteria will be as follows:

When A is deep  and B is Hello_123 and C is deep@gmail.com the result is 1.
When A is anuj  and B is Awesome_123 and C is anuj@ymail.com the result is 1.
When A is ajay  and B is 232132 and C is ajay@hotmail.com the result is ERROR.
When A is nikhil and B is Great_123 and C is nikgmail.com the result is ERROR.
When A is ami  and B is Ami_1234 and C is ami@gmail.com the result is ERROR.
